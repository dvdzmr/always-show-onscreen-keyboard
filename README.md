# Always allow onscreen keyboard

Based on the work of https://gitlab.com/cczp/act-2/force-show-osk/


Force use of onscreen keyboard, regardless whether the device is in touch mode. 
This is especially useful for 2-in-1 devices, where flipping back the keyboard does not automatically put gnome in touch mode.
